### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my github page!

Here you can find some of the projects I've been working on as a student. Among them are machine learning models, source code for games created during game jams, and more. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a pretty big game project which is kind of top secret for now ðŸ‘€
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create stuff with game engines, game design and music theory ðŸŽ¶

If I'm not coding, I'm probably writing songs or climbing. Mostly those two things actually.

If you want to contact me, feel free to reach me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieu-deloffre-defgecd/).
All of the games mentioned above can be found on [itch.io](https://ohmlet.itch.io/)
